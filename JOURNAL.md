6/4/25 Update #1 on Call
I made the schematic and PCB. Schematic was super simple as its just a Hackpad. PCB was a bit harder. Positioning was super hard, but I just used X and Y coordinates. Routing was beyond easy and took no time. My only concern is that my MCU pins will scrape the buttons... but people said it is fine.
